 Appcelerator Titanium Developer
---------------------------------


Titanium Developer has been replaced by Titanium Studio. Although the source code remains open source, and the appcelerator will no longer be maintaining this code or releasing any new versions.

However, I think I am making improvements necessary to continue this tool as well.

Everyone can help in this project by sending ideas or making changes to the code.


---------------------------------


This is the source code for the Titanium Developer desktop application
that is a visual environment for the Titanium SDKs.
